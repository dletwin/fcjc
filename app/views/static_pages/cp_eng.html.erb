  <h4>Common Catholic Prayers (English)</h4>

  <h4>Sign of the Cross</h4>
  <p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Our Father</h4>
  <p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy
    will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread
    and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us and
    lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Hail Mary</h4>
  <p>Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women
     and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray
     for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Glory Be</h4>
  <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in
    the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Apostles’ Creed</h4>
  <p>I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth, and in
    Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
    born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died,
    and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the
    dead; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father;
    from thence he shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the
    Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
    of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Prayers to Our Lady:
  The Rosary</h4>
  <p>The six fundamental prayers listed above are also part of the Catholic
    rosary, a devotion dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, the Mother of God. (CCC 971)
    The rosary consists of fifteen decades. Each decade focuses upon a particular
    mystery in the life of Christ and his Blessed Mother. It is customary to say
    five decades at a time, while meditating upon one set of mysteries.</p>

  <h4>Hail Holy Queen</h4>
  <p>Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of mercy, our light, our sweetness, and our hope.
    To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our
    sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of tears. Turn then, most gracious
    advocate, thine eyes of mercy towards us and after this, our exile, show unto
    us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin
    Mary. V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. R. That we may be made worthy of
    the promises of Christ.</p>

  <h4>Memorare</h4>
  <p>Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone
    who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thy intercession
    was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, we turn to thee, O Virgin
    of virgins, our Mother. To thee we come, before thee we stand, sinful and
    sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, do not despise our petitions, but
    in thy mercy hear and answer us. Amen.</p>

  <h4>The Angelus</h4>
  <p>The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary.<br>
    R.And she conceived of the Holy Spirit. (Hail Mary . . .)<br>
    Behold the handmaid of the Lord.<br>
    R.Be it done unto me according to thy word. (Hail Mary ...)<br>
    And the Word was made flesh.<br>
    R.And dwelt among us. (Hail Mary ...)<br>
    Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.<br>
    R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Let us pray: Pour
    forth, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy grace into our hearts; that, we to whom
    the incarnation of Christ, thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel,
    may by his passion and cross, be brought to the glory of his resurrection,
    through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Daily Prayers:<br>
    Prayer Before Meals</h4>
    <p>Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from
       thy bounty, through Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Prayer to Our Guardian Angel</h4>
  <p>Angel of God, my guardian dear, to whom God’s love commits me here, ever
    this day be at my side to light and guard, to rule and guide. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Morning Offering</h4>
  <p>O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer you my prayers,
    works, joys, and sufferings of this day in union with the holy sacrifice of
    the Mass throughout the world. I offer them for all the intentions of your
    sacred heart: the salvation of souls, reparation for sin, the reunion of all
    Christians. I offer them for the intentions of our bishops and of all the
    apostles of prayer, and in particular for those recommended by our Holy
    Father this month.</p>

  <h4>Evening prayer</h4>
  <p>O my God, at the end of this day I thank you most heartily for all the
    graces I have received from you. I am sorry that I have not made a better
    use of them. I am sorry for all the sins I have committed against you.
    Forgive me, O my God, and graciously protect me this night. Blessed Virgin
    Mary, my dear heavenly mother, take me under your protection. St. Joseph, my
    dear guardian angel, and all you saints of God, pray for me. Sweet Jesus,
    have pity on all poor sinners, and save them from hell. Have mercy on the
    suffering souls in purgatory.</p>

  <p>(Generally, this evening prayer is followed by an act of contrition, which
    is usually said in conjunction with an examination of conscience. A daily
    examination of conscience consists of a brief recounting of our actions
    during the day. What sins did we commit? Where did we fail? In what areas
    of our lives can we strive to make virtuous progress? Having determined our
    failures and sins, we make an act of contrition.)</p>

  <h4>Act of Contrition</h4>
  <p>O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee and I detest all my
    sins, because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell, but most of
    all because they offend thee, my God, who are all good and deserving of all
    my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins,
    to do penance, and to amend my life.</p>

  <h4>Prayer after Mass:<br>
    Anima Christi</h4>
  <p>Soul of Christ, make me holy. Body of Christ, save me. Blood of Christ,
    fill me with love. Water from Christ’s side, wash me. Passion of Christ,
    strengthen me. Good Jesus, hear me. Within your wounds, hide me. Never let
    me be parted from you. From the evil enemy, protect me. At the hour of my
    death, call me, and tell me to come to you that with your saints I may
    praise you through all eternity. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Prayers to the Holy Spirit:<br>
    Prayer to the Holy Spirit</h4>
  <p>Breathe into me Holy Spirit, that all my thoughts may be holy. Move in me,
    Holy Spirit, that my work, too, may be holy. Attract my heart, Holy Spirit,
    that I may love only what is holy. Strengthen me, Holy Spirit, that I may
    defend all that is holy. Protect me, Holy Spirit, that I always may be holy.</p>

  <h4>Come, Holy Spirit</h4>
  <p>Come, O Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and enkindle in them
    the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they shall be created.
    And you shall renew the face of the earth.</p>

  <h4>Let us pray</h4>
  <p>O God, who has taught the hearts of the faithful by the light of the Holy
    Spirit, grant that by the gift of the same Spirit we may be always truly
    wise and ever rejoice in his consolation, through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Prayers to the Angels and Saints:<br>
    Prayer to Saint Joseph</h4>
  <p>O glorious Saint Joseph, you were chosen by God to be the foster father of
    Jesus, the most pure spouse of Mary, ever virgin, and the head of the Holy
    Family. You have been chosen by Christ’s vicar as the heavenly patron and
    protector of the Church founded by Christ.</p>
  <p>Protect the Holy Father, our sovereign pontiff, and all bishops and priests
    united with him. Be the protector of all who labor for souls amid the trials
    and tribulations of this life, and grant that all peoples of the world may
    follow Christ and the Church he founded.</p>
  <p>Dear St. Joseph, accept the offering I make to you. Be my father, protector,
    and guide in the way of salvation. Obtain for me purity of heart and a love
    for the spiritual life. After your example, let all my actions be directed
    to the greater glory of God, in union with the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the
    Immaculate Heart of Mary, and your own paternal heart. Finally, pray for me
    that I may share in the peace and joy of your holy death. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Prayer to Saint Michael the Archangel</h4>
  <p>St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle; be our defense against the
    wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and
    do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into
    hell Satan and all the other evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking
    the ruin of souls. Amen.</p>

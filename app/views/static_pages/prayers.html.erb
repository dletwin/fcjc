  <h4>Prayers</h4>
  <p>Prayers are very important and a way of life for all Catholic Christians like
   members of Families in Christ Jesus Community. Since we are a united church,
   here are some prayers that can help in our personal, family and even prayer
   gatherings. Just click on the icon to view the prayers for that category.</p>
